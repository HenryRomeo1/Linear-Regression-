## ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression (Simple and Multivariate)

**Problem Statement**:  
Predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.

**Data**:  
- Source: Simple regression (`Pearson`).
- Description: CSV files containing independent and dependent variable data.

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- Loaded data, explored initial distributions.
- Conducted simple and multiple linear regression models.
- Preprocessed data (normalization using Min-Max Scaling).
- Generated correlation matrix and heatmaps.
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Trained and evaluated model using performance metrics.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Regression plots.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Evaluation metrics (MSE, RÂ² Score).

**Limitations**:  
- Small dataset sizes could introduce variance in performance metrics.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, models achieved reasonable fits, and predictions aligned with expected trends.
